# Preprocessing---stemming
This project shows a simple NLP preprocessing technique called stemming using Python and the NLTK library. It tokenizes text into words and reduces them to their root form using the Porter Stemmer. Stemming helps group similar words, improving tasks like text analysis, search, and machine learning applications. Beginner-friendly and easy to run.
